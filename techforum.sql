(1, 3, 4, 'Before we can use our weights, we have to initialize them. Because we don’t have values to use for the weights yet, we use random values between 0 and 1.\r\nIn Python, the random.seed function generates “random numbers.” However, random numbers are not truly random. The numbers generated are pseudorandom, meaning the numbers are generated by a complicated formula that makes it look random. In order to generate numbers, the formula takes the previous value generated as its input. If there is no previous value generated, it often takes the time as a first value.\r\nThat is why we seed the generator?—?to make sure that we always get the same random numbers. We provide a fixed value that the number generator can start with, which is zero in this case.\r\nnp.random.seed(0)', '2018-07-30 12:02:47'),
(2, 3, 5, 'There are roughly two parts of training a neural network. First, you are propagating forward through the NN. That is, you are “making steps” forward and comparing those results with the real values to get the difference between your output and what it should be. You basically see how the NN is doing and find the errors.\r\nAfter we have initialized the weights with a pseudo-random number, we take a linear step forward. We calculate this by taking our input A0 times the dot product of the random initialized weights plus a bias. We started with a bias of 0. This is represented as:\r\n\r\n', '2018-07-30 12:02:47'),
(3, 3, 1, 'Now we take our z1 (our linear step) and pass it through our first activation function. Activation functions are very important in neural networks. Essentially, they convert an input signal to an output signal?—?this is why they are also known as Transfer functions. They introduce non-linear properties to our functions by converting the linear input to a non-linear output, making it possible to represent more complex functions.\r\nThere are different kinds of activation functions (explained in depth in this article). For this model, we chose to use the tanh activation function for our two hidden layers?—?A1 and A2?—?which gives us an output value between 0 and -1.\r\nSince this is a multi-class classification problem (we have 3 output labels), we will use the softmax function for the output layer?—?A3?—?because this will compute the probabilities for the classes by spitting out a value between 0 and 1.', '2018-07-30 12:04:58'),
(4, 2, 1, 'After we forward propagate through our NN, we backward propagate our error gradient to update our weight parameters. We know our error, and want to minimize it as much as possible.\r\nWe do this by taking the derivative of the error function, with respect to the weights (W) of our NN, using gradient descent.\r\nLets visualize this process with an analogy.\r\nImagine you went out for a walk in the mountains during the afternoon. But now its an hour later and you are a bit hungry, so it’s time to go home. The only problem is that it is dark and there are many trees, so you can’t see either your home or where you are. Oh, and you forgot your phone at home.\r\nBut then you remember your house is in a valley, the lowest point in the whole area. So if you just walk down the mountain step by step until you don’t feel any slope, in theory you should arrive at your home.\r\nSo there you go, step by step carefully going down. Now think of the mountain as the loss function, and you are the algorithm, trying to find your home (i.e. the lowest point). Every time you take a step downwards, we update your location coordinates (the algorithm updates the parameters).', '2018-07-30 12:04:58'),
(5, 2, 5, 'The loss function is represented by the mountain. To get to a low loss, the algorithm follows the slope?—?that is the derivative?—?of the loss function.\r\nWhen we walk down the mountain, we are updating our location coordinates. The algorithm updates the parameters of the neural network. By getting closer to the minimum point, we are approaching our goal of minimizing our error.\r\nIn reality, gradient descent looks more like this:', '2018-07-30 12:06:21'),
(6, 1, 5, 'We always start with calculating the slope of the loss function with respect to z, the slope of the linear step we take.\r\nNotation is as follows: dv is the derivative of the loss function, with respect to a variable v.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext we calculate the slope of the loss function with respect to our weights and biases. Because this is a 3 layer NN, we will iterate this process for z3,2,1 + W3,2,1 and b3,2,1. Propagating backwards from the output to the input layer.', '2018-07-30 12:06:21'),
